# Explanation:
### Method Signature:
public static int palinArray(int[] a, int n): This method takes an array of integers a and its length n as parameters. It is expected to return 1 if all numbers in the array are palindrome, and 0 otherwise.
Variables:
int y = 0;: This variable is used to count the number of palindrome numbers in the array.
For Loop:

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++): This loop iterates through each element of the array.
Palindrome Check:

int x = a[i];: This assigns the current array element to the variable x.
int temp = x;: This stores the original value of x in temp for later comparison.
int rev = 0;: This variable will store the reverse of the number.
While Loop (Reverse the Number):

while (x > 0): This loop iterates through each digit of the number and constructs its reverse.
rev = (rev * 10) + (x % 10);: This line adds the last digit of x to the reversed number rev.
x = x / 10;: This removes the last digit from x.
Palindrome Check (Continued):

if (rev == temp) y = y + 1;: If the reversed number is equal to the original number, increment the palindrome count y.
Final Check and Return:

if (y == n) return 1;: If the count of palindrome numbers equals the total number of elements, return 1.
else return 0;: Otherwise, return 0.
