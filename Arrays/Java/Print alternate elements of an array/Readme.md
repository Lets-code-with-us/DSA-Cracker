The provided Java code is part of a simple program that reads an integer `t` denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the size of an array, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array. The main functionality is encapsulated in the `GfG` class, which contains a static method `print`. This method takes an integer array `arr` and an integer `n` as parameters and prints every alternate element of the array starting from the first element. The main function instantiates an object of the `GfG` class and calls the `print` method for each test case. The program outputs the alternate elements of each array in the specified format. Overall, the code is straightforward and easy to understand, utilizing a simple loop to print alternate elements of the array.
