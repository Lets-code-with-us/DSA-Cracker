- The code uses a stack to evaluate Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) expressions where operators follow operands.

- A stack of type `Long` is initialized to store operands during the evaluation.

- The code iterates through each token in the input array.

- If the token is an operand, it is converted to a `Long` and pushed onto the stack.

- If the token is an operator, the top two operands are popped from the stack, the operation is performed, and the result is pushed back onto the stack.

- The final result, converted to an integer, is obtained by popping the only element left in the stack.
