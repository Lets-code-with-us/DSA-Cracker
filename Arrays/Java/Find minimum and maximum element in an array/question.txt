Given an array A of size N of integers. Your task is to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 6
A[] = {3, 2, 1, 56, 10000, 167}
Output: 1 10000
Explanation: minimum and maximum elements of array are 1 and 10000.
 
Example 2:
Input:
N = 5
A[]  = {1, 345, 234, 21, 56789}
Output: 1 56789
Explanation: minimum and maximum element of array are 1 and 56789.
 
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getMinMax() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns the minimum and maximum element of the array.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Ai <=1012

Answer :

class Compute {
    static Pair getMinMax(long a[], long n) {
        long m = Long.MAX_VALUE; //100000000
        long M = Long.MIN_VALUE; //0

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (a[i] > M) M = a[i];
            if (a[i] < m) m = a[i];
        }

        return new Pair(m, M);
    }
}

Explanation : 
This code finds the minimum (m) and maximum (M) values in an array of long integers and returns them as a Pair object. 
The variables m and M are initialized to the maximum and minimum possible values for long integers, and then the array is iterated through to update these values based on the elements in the array. 
Finally, a Pair object is created with the found minimum and maximum values and returned.
