# Check if Array is Perfect

## Class: Solution

This class contains a method to check if a given array is perfect.

### Method: `IsPerfect`

Checks if the given array is perfect.

#### Parameters

- `a[]`: An array of integers.
- `n`: An integer representing the size of the array.

#### Returns

A boolean value:
- `true` if the array is perfect.
- `false` otherwise.

### Approach

The `IsPerfect` method checks if the given array is perfect or not.

1. **Base Case:**
   - If the size of the array `n` is 1, return `true` as a single-element array is considered perfect.

2. **Array Comparison:**
   - Iterate through the array elements from both ends (i.e., from index `0` to `(n/2)+1` and from index `n-1` to `(n/2)+1`).
   - For each iteration:
      - Check if the element at index `i` is equal to the element at index `j`.
      - If the elements are not equal, return `false`, indicating that the array is not perfect.

3. **Result:**
   - After iterating through all elements, return `true`, indicating that the array is perfect.

The approach efficiently checks if the given array is perfect by comparing elements from both ends of the array towards the middle. If any pair of elements doesn't match, it returns `false`; otherwise, it returns `true`.
