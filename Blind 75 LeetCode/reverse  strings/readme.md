## Reversing Bits of an Unsigned Integer: Bitwise Operations

This code implements efficient bitwise operations to reverse the bits of an unsigned integer in Java.

**Problem Statement:**

Given an unsigned integer `n`, reverse the order of its bits and return the resulting integer.

**Key Points:**

- **Unsigned Integers:** In unsigned integers, the leftmost bit (most significant bit) is not used to represent the sign.
- **Bitwise Operations:**
    - `&` (AND): Performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding bits of two operands. It results in 1 only if both bits are 1s.
    - `<<` (Left Shift): Shifts the bits of an operand to the left by a specified number of positions.
    - `|` (OR): Performs a bitwise OR operation on corresponding bits of two operands. It results in 1 if either or both bits are 1s.
    - `>>>` (Unsigned Right Shift): Shifts the bits of an operand to the right by a specified number of positions, preserving the zero at the leftmost position for unsigned integers.

**Solution Approach:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an integer `reversed` to store the reversed bits, initialized to 0.

2. **Iteration and Bit Manipulation:**
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate 32 times (as most integers in Java use 32 bits).
   - Inside the loop:
     - **Extract LSB:** Use `n & 1` to isolate the least significant bit (LSB) of `n`.
     - **Shift Reversed:** Shift the existing `reversed` bits left by 1 using `<< 1` to make space for the extracted LSB.
     - **Add LSB:** Use `|` to combine the shifted `reversed` bits with the extracted LSB, effectively adding the LSB to the reversed representation.
     - **Right Shift n:** Shift `n` by 1 to the right using `>>> 1` to remove the processed LSB from further consideration in the next iteration.

3. **Return Reversed:**
   - After the loop completes, the `reversed` integer holds the reversed bits of the original `n`. Return this value.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

- Time complexity: O(1), as the loop iterates a constant number of times (32) independent of the input size.
- Space complexity: O(1), as it uses constant extra space for variables.

**Additional Notes:**

- This explanation aims to be educational and might not be optimized for performance-critical scenarios.
- Understanding bitwise operations is crucial for various applications, including efficient data manipulation and low-level programming.
