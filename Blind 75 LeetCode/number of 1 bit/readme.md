## Counting Set Bits: Understanding the Bitwise AND and Right Shift Operations

This code dives into the problem of counting the number of set bits (1s) in an unsigned integer in Java, utilizing bitwise and right shift operations.

**Problem Statement:**

Given an unsigned integer `n`, find the number of set bits (1s) in its binary representation.

**Key Points:**

- **Unsigned Integers:** In unsigned integers, the leftmost bit (most significant bit) is not used to represent the sign.
- **Counting Set Bits:** We need to efficiently count the number of 1s present in the binary representation of `n`.

**Solution Approach:**

This solution employs the following techniques:

1. **Bitwise AND (`&`) operator:** Performs a bitwise AND operation between two numbers, resulting in 1 only if both corresponding bits are 1s.
2. **Right Shift (`>>>`) operator:** Shifts the bits of an integer to the right by a specified number of positions.

**Explanation:**

1. **`Solution` Class:**
   - The code defines a class named `Solution` with a static method called `hammingWeight`.

2. **`hammingWeight` Method:**
   - **`public static int hammingWeight(int n)`:** This method takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of set bits.

3. **`count` Variable:**
   - **`int count = 0;`:** Initializes a variable `count` to store the total number of set bits found.

4. **`while (n != 0)` Loop:**
   - This loop iterates as long as `n` is not zero, ensuring all bits in the integer are checked.

5. **Checking Least Significant Bit (LSB):**
   - **`if ((n & 1) == 1)`:**
     - The bitwise AND operation with 1 (`n & 1`) isolates the LSB of `n`.
     - The condition `== 1` checks if the LSB is indeed set (1).

6. **Incrementing Count:**
   - **`count++`:** If the LSB is set, `count` is incremented to keep track of the set bits.

7. **Shifting Right:**
   - **`n >>>= 1`:** Shifts the bits in `n` one position to the right, effectively making the next bit the new LSB for the next iteration.

8. **Returning Count:**
   - After the loop completes, `count` contains the total number of set bits in `n`. The method returns this value.

9. **Optional `main` Method:**
   - This method (not essential for functionality) demonstrates how to use the `hammingWeight` method with an example input (`11`) and print the result.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of bits in the integer (typically 32 for `int` in Java).
- Space complexity: O(1) as it uses constant extra space for variables.

**Additional Notes:**

- This explanation aims to be educational and might not be optimized for performance-critical scenarios.
- Understanding bitwise operations can open doors to various applications, including efficient manipulation of binary data.
