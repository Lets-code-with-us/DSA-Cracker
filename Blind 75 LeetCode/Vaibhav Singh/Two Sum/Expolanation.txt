Using a hash map:

Create an empty hash map to store elements and their indices.
Iterate through the array from left to right.
For each element nums[i], calculate the complement by subtracting it from the target: complement = target - nums[i].
Check if the complement exists in the hash table. If it does, we have found a solution.
If the complement does not exist in the hash table, add the current element nums[i] to the hash map with its index as the value.
Repeat steps 3-5 until we find a solution or reach the end of the array.
If no solution is found, return an empty array or an appropriate indicator.
Time complexity: O(n) 
Space complexity: O(n)
