0) Keep Calculating the net profit by the difference between the minimum element of the previous elements and the current element and keep updating the maximum element.

Approach
1) Initialise a profit and a max_profit varible to zero and a mini variable to INT_MAX so that no element greater than mini can exist in the given array.
2) Iterate throughout the given vector and keep checking the minimum element then calculating the profit(prices[i]-mini) and then keeping updating the max_profit if   
   profit exceeds the max_profit.
3) Return max_profit.
