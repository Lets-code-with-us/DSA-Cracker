## Procedure for Counting Set Bits Using Dynamic Programming

1. **Clone the repository:**
   - Use the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<username>/<repository-name>.git
     ```
   - Replace `<username>` with the owner of the repository and `<repository-name>` with the actual repository name.

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   - Navigate to the cloned repository using the `cd` command:
     ```bash
     cd <repository-name>
     ```

3. **Open the `Solution.java` file:**
   - Open the `Solution.java` file using a text editor or an IDE of your choice.

4. **Review the code:**
   - Carefully examine the Java code provided in the `countBits` method.
   - Refer to the explanation in the Markdown documentation for a comprehensive understanding.

5. **Run the code:**
   - Compile and run the Java code using your preferred method (e.g., command-line or within your IDE).
   - Provide an input value for `n` when prompted.

6. **Observe the output:**
   - The program will output an array containing the count of set bits for each number from 0 to the input value `n`.

7. **Explore further:**
   - Try different input values for `n` to observe the results.
   - Consider experimenting with alternative approaches to counting set bits, such as using bitwise operations or lookup tables.
