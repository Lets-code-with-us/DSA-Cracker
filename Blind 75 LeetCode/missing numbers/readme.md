## Finding the Missing Number: Using Arithmetic Series

This code utilizes the concept of arithmetic series to efficiently find the missing number in a Java array containing distinct numbers from 0 to `n`, where `n` is the length of the array.

**Problem Statement:**

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct integers from 0 to `n` (inclusive), where one number is missing, find the missing number.

**Solution Approach:**

This approach leverages the property of an arithmetic series: the sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:

n * (a + l) / 2


where:

- `n` is the number of terms
- `a` is the first term
- `l` is the last term

**Explanation:**

1. **Expected Sum:**
   - We know the array contains `n` distinct numbers from 0 to `n`.
   - The sum of all numbers from 0 to `n` forms an arithmetic series.
   - Calculate the `expectedSum` using the formula: `n * (0 + n) / 2` (where `a = 0` and `l = n`).

2. **Actual Sum:**
   - Initialize an `actualSum` variable to 0.
   - Iterate through the `nums` array using a `for` loop.
   - For each element `num` in the array:
     - Add `num` to the `actualSum`.

3. **Missing Number:**
   - The difference between the `expectedSum` (sum of all numbers) and the `actualSum` (sum of elements in the array) will be the missing number, as one number is missing.
   - Calculate the missing number as `expectedSum - actualSum`.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

- Time complexity: O(n), as the loop iterates through the array once.
- Space complexity: O(1), as it uses constant extra space for variables.

**Additional Notes:**

- This approach assumes that the missing number is within the range of 0 to `n`.
- It offers a concise and efficient solution for this specific problem
