# Two Sum Problem Solution Explanation

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, the task is to find two numbers in the array such that their sum equals the target. You need to return the indices of the two numbers.

## Approach
We can solve this problem using a HashMap to store the complement of each element. The complement of an element `nums[i]` is `target - nums[i]`. 

1. Create a HashMap to store the complement of each element.
   - Key: complement (`target - nums[i]`)
   - Value: index of the corresponding element (`i`)
   
2. Iterate through the array `nums`.
   - For each element `nums[i]`, calculate its complement (`target - nums[i]`).
   - Check if the complement exists in the HashMap.
     - If found, return the indices of the two numbers: `map.get(complement)` and `i`.
     - If not found, add the current element to the HashMap (`map.put(nums[i], i)`).
     
3. If no solution is found after iterating through the array, return an empty array.

## Time Complexity
- Since we iterate through the array once, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

## Space Complexity
- We use a HashMap to store the elements and their indices, which can have a maximum of n elements.
- So, the space complexity is O(n).
