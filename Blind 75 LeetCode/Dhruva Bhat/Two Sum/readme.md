# Code Explanation: Two Sum Problem - Java Solution

## Explanation:

### HashMap Initialization:
- A `HashMap` named `map` is initialized to store the complement and its corresponding index.

### Iterating through Array:
- The code uses a `for` loop to iterate through the array `A`.

### Checking for Complement in HashMap:
- It checks if the complement of the current element (`k - A[i]`) exists in the HashMap.
- If found, it returns the indices of the two numbers.

### Storing Complement in HashMap:
- If the complement is not found, it puts the complement (`k - A[i]`) and its index `i` into the HashMap.

## Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n) - where `n` is the length of the array.
- Space Complexity: O(n) - due to the HashMap storing at most `n` elements.
