**Class Name:**

* `Solution`

**Method:**

* `public int maxSubArray(int[] nums)`:
    - Takes an integer array `nums` representing a sequence of numbers.
    - Returns the maximum subarray sum, which is the largest sum of contiguous elements in the array.

**Logic:**

1. **Initialization:**
    - `n`: Stores the length of the input array `nums`.
    - `max`: Initializes a variable `max` to `Integer.MIN_VALUE` to track the maximum subarray sum found so far (negative infinity).
    - `sum`: Initializes a variable `sum` to 0 to accumulate the sum of elements in the current subarray.

2. **Iteration:**
    - Iterates through each element `nums[i]` in the array using a for loop:
        - Adds the current element `nums[i]` to the `sum`.
        - Updates `max` to the greater of its current value and the current `sum`. This ensures we capture the maximum subarray sum encountered so far.
        - Resets `sum` to 0 if it becomes negative. This is because any negative subarray sum cannot contribute to a larger positive subarray sum moving forward.

3. **Return Result:**
    - After iterating through the entire array, returns the final value of `max`, which represents the maximum subarray sum found.

**Key Points:**

- Employs a single loop to iterate through the array and maintain the current subarray sum.
- Uses `max` to keep track of the largest subarray sum encountered during the iteration.
- Resets `sum` to 0 if it becomes negative to avoid carrying over negative values to future subarrays.

**Assumptions:**

- The input array `nums` may contain both positive and negative integers.
- An empty array should return 0 as the maximum subarray sum.

**Example:**

Consider the input array `nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`.

- The code iterates through the array, calculating subarray sums and updating `max` accordingly.
- `sum` is reset to 0 after encountering `-3`, as the previous subarray cannot contribute to a larger positive sum.
- The final value of `max` is 6, which corresponds to the subarray `[4, -1, 2, 1]`.

I hope this explanation is helpful and addresses the feedback received!
