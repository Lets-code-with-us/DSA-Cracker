# Maximum Subarray Sum

## Introduction

The given algorithm aims to find the maximum sum of a subarray within a given array. It uses a single-pass approach to iterate through the array and update the maximum sum accordingly.

## Approach

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize `maxsum` to the minimum possible integer value (`Integer.MIN_VALUE`) to ensure it gets updated in the first iteration.
   - Initialize `max` and set it to 0.

2. **Iteration:**
   - Iterate through the array.
   - For each element at index `i`, update `max` by adding the current element `nums[i]`.
   - Use `Math.max` to update `max` by taking the maximum value between the current `max` and the current element `nums[i]`.
   - Update `maxsum` by taking the maximum value between the current `max` and the current `maxsum`.

3. **Result:**
   - The final value of `maxsum` represents the maximum sum of a subarray within the given array.

## Time Complexity

The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array. It iterates through the array once, making constant-time comparisons and updates.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(1), as the algorithm uses a constant amount of additional space regardless of the input array size.

## Usage

This algorithm is useful when finding the maximum subarray sum in a given array is required. It provides an efficient and concise solution with linear time complexity and constant space usage.
