# Code Explanation: 3 Sum - java Solution

##Intuition

The problem requires finding all unique triplets in an array that sum up to zero. The intuition here is to use a two-pointer approach after sorting the array. By fixing one element and using two pointers to find the other two elements, we can efficiently search for the triplets in a sorted array.

##Approach

The approach used in this code is as follows:

Sort the input array in non-decreasing order.

Iterate over the sorted array up to the second-to-last element (i < nums.length - 2).

For each element at index i, check if it is the first occurrence of that value or if it's different from the previous element. This step ensures that we avoid duplicate triplets.

Set the target value as the negative of the current element (-nums[i]).

Use two pointers, one starting from the element at index i+1 (left pointer) and the other starting from the last element (right pointer).

While the left pointer is less than the right pointer, perform the following steps:

. Calculate the sum of the values at the left and right pointers.

. If the sum is equal to the target value, we found a triplet. Add it to the result set.

. If the sum is less than the target value, increment the left pointer to consider a larger element.

. If the sum is greater than the target value, decrement the right .pointer to consider a smaller element.

. If the left or right pointers point to duplicate elements, skip them to avoid duplicate triplets.

Repeat steps 3-6 until we have considered all the elements in the array.

Return the result set containing all unique triplets that sum up to zero.

Complexity

Time complexity:

The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2), where n is the size of the input array. The sorting operation takes O(n log n) time, and the nested loop takes O(n^2) time in the worst case.

Space complexity:

The space complexity is O(1) since the code uses a constant amount of extra space for variables and the result set. The input array is sorted in-place without using additional memory.
