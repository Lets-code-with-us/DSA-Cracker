# Code Explanation: Container With Most Water - java Solution

## Explanation:
Intuition
The maximum area between two vertical lines can be obtained by considering the width between the lines (indices) and the minimum height of the two lines.

Approach
Check if the height array is null or has fewer than 2 elements. If so, return 0 since there are not enough bars to form an area.
Initialize a variable max to keep track of the maximum area encountered so far.
Initialize two pointers, left and right, pointing to the first and last elements of the height array, respectively.
Use a while loop that continues until left is less than right:
Calculate the current area as (right - left) * Math.min(height[left], height[right]).
Update max with the maximum value between the current max and the calculated area.
Move the pointer with the smaller height towards the center:
If height[left] is less than height[right], increment left by 1.
Otherwise, decrement right by 1.
After the loop, return the maximum area stored in max.
