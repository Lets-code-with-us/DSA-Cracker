# Code Explanation: Maximum Subarray - java Solution

Intuition

The problem seems to be related to finding the maximum sum subarray within a given array. The provided code looks like it's implementing Kadane's algorithm, a well-known algorithm for solving this type of problem

Approach

The approach used in the code is to iterate through the array and maintain two variables: sum and max. sum keeps track of the current sum of the subarray ending at the current element, and max keeps track of the maximum sum encountered so far. If sum becomes negative, it is reset to 0 since any negative contribution would only decrease the overall sum
