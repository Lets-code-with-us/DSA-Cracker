# Code Explanation: Longest Increasing Subsequence - java Solution

Initialization: 
The code initializes variables n and m to store the lengths of the input strings s1 and s2 respectively. It also initializes a 2-D array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1) for dynamic programming.

Tabulation: 
The nested loops iterate over each character of both strings. For each pair of characters (i, j), if they match, it increments the length of the LCS by 1 compared to the LCS of the substrings without these characters. Otherwise, it takes the maximum LCS length from the previous characters, either by excluding the character from s1 or excluding the character from s2.

Return:
Finally, it returns dp[n][m], which holds the length of the LCS between the two strings.

Complexity:

Time Complexity: The time complexity of this dynamic programming approach is O(n * m), where n and m are the lengths of the input strings.
Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n * m) as well, since we are using a 2-D array of size (n+1) x (m+1) for dynamic programming.
