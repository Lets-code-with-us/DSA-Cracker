# Code Explanation: counting Bits- java Solution

## Explanation:


This code counts the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of numbers from 0 to n using dynamic programming. 
It iterates through numbers from 0 to n and calculates the count of set bits for each number based on whether it's even or odd. 
For even numbers, it's the same as half of the number, and for odd numbers, it's one more than half of the number. Finally, it returns an array storing the count of set bits for each number.
