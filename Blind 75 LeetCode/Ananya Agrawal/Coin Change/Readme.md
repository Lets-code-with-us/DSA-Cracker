# Code Explanation: Coin Change - java Solution

The code defines a method coinChange within a class Solution.

It takes an array of coin denominations (coins) and a target amount (amount) as input.

It creates an array dp to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from 0 to amount.

Initially, all elements of dp are set to amount + 1 to represent an unreachable value.

The value at index 0 of dp is set to 0, indicating that no coins are needed to make change for 0 amount.

It iterates through each coin denomination in the coins array.

For each coin denomination, it iterates from the coin value to the target amount.

Within the nested loop, it updates dp[i] with the minimum of its current value and the value at dp[i - c] + 1, where c is the current coin denomination.

Finally, it returns dp[amount] if it's less than or equal to amount, otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that it's not possible to make change for the target amount using the given coin denominations.
