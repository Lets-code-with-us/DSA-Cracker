This solution tackles the Two Sum problem, where you're given an array of integers `nums` and a target integer `target`. The task is to find two numbers in the array that sum up to the target and return their indices.

Here's the approach:

1. **Initialize a hash map (`unordered_map<int, int> m`):** This map will store the elements of the array `nums` along with their indices.

2. **Iterate through the array `nums`:** For each element in the array, do the following:
   
   a. Calculate the difference `toFind = target - nums[i]`. This represents the value that, when added to `nums[i]`, will equal the target.

   b. Check if the `toFind` value exists in the hash map (`m`). If it does, and the index stored for `toFind` is not the same as the current index (`i`), then we have found a pair that sums up to the target.

   c. If such a pair is found, return the indices of the two elements that sum up to the target.

   d. If the pair is not found, store the current element along with its index in the hash map `m`.

3. If no pair is found throughout the array traversal, return an empty vector `res`, as there are no such pairs.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array `nums`, as it requires a single pass through the array. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the usage of the hash map `m`, where n is the number of elements in the array.
