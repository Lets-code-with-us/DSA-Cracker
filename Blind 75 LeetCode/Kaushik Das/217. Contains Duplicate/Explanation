In This We Have To find That Does any Element Has 2 more more Appearence or not .
if does then return true or return false
so , Simple Question for Map . Take A Map and put Integer as Key and occurence as Value . 
like , Example :1 nums = [1,2,3,1]
Take map for nums . put element at map. 

syntax-> " store.put(nums[i], store.getOrDefault(nums[i],0)+1 ); " .

 After done the put part . map Look like
  [
    1 -> 2 ,
    2 -> 1 ,
    3 -> 1 ,
  ]  
 means  1 has 2 times. and 2 has 1 times and 3 has 1 times . so clearly 1 has 2 times so return true.
