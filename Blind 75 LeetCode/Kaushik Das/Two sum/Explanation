We have to Find TWO number's index which sum meet the Target. So We used HashMap to Store All the Integer and there index .

Now for exmaple 1 -->  nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Once We Store All Integer At Map .
Now map will be 
[ 2 -> 0 ,
  7-> 1 ,
  11-> 2,
  15 ->3
]

Then We run a for loop and Subtract nums[i] value from target.
 like we have nums array --> [2,7,11,15] . The First value 2 . if We subtract Target(9) from Nums first
 index value(2) .it will be (9-2)=7. Now Main Part If 7 already has in Map then We got Our two number ( like first 2 + map has 7 = 9 the target) okk.
 Now Simple return index of value(2) is '0'  and map key's(7) value '1'. return [0,1].
