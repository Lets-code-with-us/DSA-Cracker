## Intuition 

We first intitialize result to 0. We then iterate from
0 to 31 (an integer has 32 bits). In each iteration:
We first shift result to the left by 1 bit.
Then, if the last digit of input n is 1, we add 1 to result. To
find the last digit of n, we just do: (n & 1)
Example, if n=5 (101), n&1 = 101 & 001 = 001 = 1;
however, if n = 2 (10), n&1 = 10 & 01 = 00 = 0).

Finally, we update n by shifting it to the right by 1 (n >>= 1). This is because the last digit is already taken care of, so we need to drop it by shifting n to the right by 1.

At the end of the iteration, we return result.
