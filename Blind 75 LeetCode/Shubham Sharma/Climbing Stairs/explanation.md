## Intuition 

* first we create a array and store the value of 0 and 1 index as 1;
* after looking closer to the stairs count we can observe that the currnt index count is equal to the sum to last two indies, so
* iterate a loop till n, and store the value of the array at their index and,
* return the last arry element at last index (n).
