Here :
  At first we are assigning the 1st value to the minprice variable and using the IF-ELSE we are comparing the ahead values to that index and 
  if the next is is found greater we are calculating the profit and by comparing the old profit the larger one is being updated to the profit variable.

  If the new value in the array is fount smaller than the old min. price the if condition is updating the variable with that value .
