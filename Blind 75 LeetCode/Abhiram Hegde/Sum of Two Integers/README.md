##Parameters:

-a: The first integer operand.

-b: The second integer operand.

##Return Type:

-int: The sum of a and b.

##Algorithm

-While Loop: The method uses a while loop to iteratively calculate the sum until there is no carry left (b becomes zero).

-Calculate Carry: Inside the loop, it calculates the carry by performing a bitwise AND operation between a and b and stores the result in carry.

-Update a: It updates a to hold the result of bitwise XOR operation between a and b, effectively adding a and b without considering the carry.

-Update b: It updates b to hold the result of left shifting carry by one position, effectively preparing it to be added to a in the next iteration.

-Return Result: Once b becomes zero, the loop terminates, and the final sum stored in a is returned as the result.
