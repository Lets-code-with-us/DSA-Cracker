###Method Description

This method takes an integer array nums as input and returns the maximum product of a subarray.

###Code Explanation

#Base Case Check: Check if the input array nums is null or empty. If it is, return 0 as there are no elements to consider.

#Initialization: 

Initialize three variables:

maxProduct: To store the maximum product found so far.

minProduct: To store the minimum product found so far.

result: To store the final result, initialized with the first element of the array.

#Iteration through Array:
Start iterating through the array nums from index 1.

#For each element at index i:

Calculate three values:

tempMaxProduct: Maximum of current element, current element times maxProduct, and current element times minProduct.

tempMinProduct: Minimum of current element, current element times maxProduct, and current element times minProduct.

Update maxProduct and minProduct with tempMaxProduct and tempMinProduct respectively.

Update result with the maximum of result and maxProduct.

Return Result: Return the final result.

Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums.

Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as it uses only a constant amount of extra space for variables.
