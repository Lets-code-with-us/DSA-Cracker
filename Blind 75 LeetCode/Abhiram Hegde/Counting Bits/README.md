## Explanation

The `Solution` class contains a method `countBits` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns an array where each element represents the number of set bits (1's) in the binary representation of the corresponding index. It achieves this by iterating from 0 to `n` and calling the `countOnes` method for each index.

The `countOnes` method takes an integer `num` and counts the number of set bits in its binary representation using bitwise operations. It iterates through the bits of the number, counting each set bit (1).

## Time Complexity

- The `countBits` method iterates from 0 to `n`, calling `countOnes` for each index. Therefore, the time complexity of `countBits` is O(n).

- The `countOnes` method iterates through the bits of the input number, which has a maximum length of logâ‚‚(num). Therefore, the time complexity of `countOnes` is O(log(num)).

Overall, the time complexity of the entire solution is dominated by the `countBits` method, which is O(n).

## Space Complexity

- The space complexity of the `result` array is O(n) because it holds the count of set bits for each index from 0 to `n`.

- There are no additional data structures used that scale with the input size, so the overall space complexity is O(n).
