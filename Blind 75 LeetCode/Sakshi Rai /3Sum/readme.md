This C++ code defines a class Solution with a member function threeSum that takes a vector of integers nums as input and returns a vector of vectors
containing unique triplets whose elements sum up to zero. The function first sorts the input array, then iterates through each element as a potential
first element of the triplet. It uses two pointers, j and k, to scan the remaining elements and find pairs that sum up to the negation of the first
element. The code avoids duplicate triplets by skipping identical elements and handles edge cases where the sum is less than, greater than, or equal
to zero. The result is a vector containing all unique triplets satisfying the sum condition.
