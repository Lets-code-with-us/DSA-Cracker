## Code Explanation: `containsDuplicate` Function

This function efficiently determines whether an integer array contains duplicate elements.

### 1. Sorting the Array

- **Code:** `Arrays.sort(nums);`
- **Explanation:** This line sorts the input array `nums` in ascending order using the `Arrays.sort` method. Sorting is crucial because it groups duplicate elements together, making them easier to detect in subsequent steps.

### 2. Iterating through the Sorted Array

- **Code:** `for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) { ... }`
- **Explanation:** This loop iterates through each element of the sorted array, starting from the first element (`i = 0`) and going up to the second-to-last element (`i < nums.length - 1`). This avoids unnecessary comparisons as the last element cannot have a duplicate to its right.

### 3. Checking for Duplicates

- **Code:** `if (nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) return true;`
- **Explanation:** This conditional statement checks if the current element (`nums[i]`) is equal to the next element (`nums[i + 1]`). If they are equal, it means a duplicate has been found, and the function immediately returns `true` to indicate the presence of duplicates.

### 4. No Duplicates Found

- **Code:** `return false;`
- **Explanation:** If the loop completes without encountering any duplicates (meaning the `if` condition never evaluates to `true`), then the function returns `false`, indicating that the array does not contain any duplicates.

### Key Points

- **Efficient Duplicate Detection:** Leveraging sorting efficiently identifies duplicates by placing them together.
- **Optimized Loop:** The loop only checks up to the second-to-last element, saving unnecessary comparisons.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) as it doesn't use significant additional memory beyond the input array.

**Remember:**

- Consider using code blocks (````java`) for code snippets.
- Include comments within code blocks for clarity.
- Adapt the explanation to your specific project's requirements and audience.
