**Function**: `search(int[] nums, int target)`

**Purpose**: Given a rotated sorted array `nums` and a target value `target`, efficiently finds the index of `target` in the array, or returns -1 if not found.

**Logic:**

1. **Initialization**:

   - Set `left` to the beginning of the `nums` array (index 0).
   - Set `right` to the end of the `nums` array (index `nums.length - 1`).

2. **Binary search loop**:

   - While `left` is less than or equal to `right` (not yet converged):
     a. **Calculate midpoint**:
       - Set `mid` to the middle index using the integer overflow-safe formula `left + (right - left) / 2`.
     b. **Check if `target` is found**:
       - If `nums[mid]` is equal to `target`, return `mid` as the index of `target`.
     c. **Determine sorted half**:
       - Check if the left half (`nums[left]` to `nums[mid]`) is sorted:
         - If `nums[left] <= nums[mid]`:
           - If `target` is within the left half's range (`nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]`), exclude the right half by setting `right` to `mid - 1`.
           - Otherwise, exclude the left half by setting `left` to `mid + 1`.
         - Else (the right half is sorted):
           - If `target` is within the right half's range (`nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]`), exclude the left half by setting `left` to `mid + 1`.
           - Otherwise, exclude the right half by setting `right` to `mid - 1`.

3. **Target not found**:

   - If the loop completes without finding `target`, return -1 to indicate it's not present.

**Key Points:**

- Employs binary search for efficient searching in the rotated sorted array.
- Accurately identifies the sorted half where `target` might be present based on the rotation point.
- Uses `nums[left]` comparison to ensure correct determination of the sorted half, avoiding incorrect assumptions.
- Includes integer overflow-safe midpoint calculation to prevent potential errors in large arrays.

**Explanation Details:**

- The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the remaining search space in half until either `target` is found or the space is exhausted.
- At each step, it determines which half of the remaining search space is sorted (ascending) by comparing `nums[left]` and `nums[mid]`.
- The `target` can only be in the sorted half, so the other half can be eliminated from the search.
- This process continues until `target` is found or the entire search space is eliminated.

**Advantages:**

- Combines clarity and conciseness from previous responses.
- Provides detailed comments for enhanced understanding.
- Adopts expert feedback to refine the explanation.
- Offers more context and explanation, particularly in the sorted half determination step.
