## Maximum Water Container: Understanding the Two-Pointer Technique

This guide dives deep into the "Container With Most Water" problem and its elegant solution using the two-pointer technique. We'll illuminate the code's functionality step by step, ensuring clarity and educational value.

**Problem Statement:**

Given an array `height` representing the heights of vertical lines drawn on the x-axis, find the maximum area of water a container can hold when formed between any two of these lines. The container's base rests on the x-axis, and its sides are vertical extensions of the lines.

**Key Points:**

- The area of the container is limited by the **shorter** of the two lines between which it's formed.
- We need to efficiently explore all possible container configurations to find the one with the maximum area.

**Solution Approach:**

The two-pointer technique shines in this scenario:

1. **Initialize pointers:**
   - `left` starts at the beginning of the array (`left = 0`).
   - `right` starts at the end of the array (`right = height.length - 1`).
   - `max_area` tracks the largest container area found so far (initially 0).

2. **Calculate current area:**
   - Determine the `current_height` as the minimum of `height[left]` and `height[right]`.
   - Calculate the `current_area` using the formula `current_height * (right - left)`. This represents the water volume a container formed by these two lines could hold.

3. **Update maximum area:**
   - Compare `current_area` with `max_area`. If `current_area` is larger, update `max_area` to capture the new maximum.

4. **Move pointers:**
   - **Crucial decision point:** To maximize the container area, we move the pointer with the **smaller** height closer to the center.
     - If `height[left] < height[right]`, move `left++` to explore a potentially taller line on the right.
     - If `height[left] >= height[right]`, move `right--` to explore a shorter line on the left without affecting the maximum area limited by the current right height.

5. **Continue loop:**
   - Repeat steps 2-4 as long as `left < right`. This ensures we consider all possible container configurations.

6. **Return result:**
   - After exploring all pairs of lines, the `max_area` variable holds the maximum water a container can hold. Return this value.

**Code Implementation (Java):**

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1, maxArea = 0;
        while (left < right) {
            int currentHeight = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
            int currentArea = currentHeight * (right - left);
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, currentArea);
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
}
