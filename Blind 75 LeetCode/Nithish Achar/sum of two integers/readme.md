## Explanation of the Sum of Two Integers Code in Java

### 1. Function Definition

- The code defines a class called `Solution` with a function named `getSum`.
- This function takes two integer arguments, `a` and `b`, and aims to return their sum.

### 2. Overflow Prevention Loop

- The code uses a `while` loop to ensure that the addition process considers potential overflows.
- The loop continues as long as `b` is not zero.

### 3. Carry Calculation

- Inside the loop, the code calculates the "carry" using a bitwise AND operation:
   ```java
   carry = a & b;
