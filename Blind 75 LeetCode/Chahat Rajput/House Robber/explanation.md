Explanation:-House Robber

Approach:-Using two variable approach it is just like fibonacci series approach.

Deatiled Approach

*Initialize two variables in which can store previous element and
move forward  to finding next greater element 

*In loop "prev1" can store maximum sum of two non-adjacent element

*In "prev2" can store previous element of "prev1"

*Atlast return "prev1" in which maximum element can store

Complexity
Time:-O(n),for traversing whole array and store maximum 
Space:-O(1),no space is used just variables is used for storing values of array.
