Explanation:-Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted array

Approach:-Break array into two parts we know that at some point we find small element and then we apply our algorithm


********** Detailed Approach ***************

*Set two variable "start" (beginning of array) and "end" (end of array)

*In a loop break array through finding mid of array

*if n[mid]>n[end] move start from mid+1 (because we find small element)

*if not then move end to mid end=mid (because small ele not lies there so move end)

*last return small element n[start]


***Complexity***

Time:-O(logN)
Space:-O(1)
