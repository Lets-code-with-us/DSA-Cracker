Expalnation:-House Robber-2

Expalantion

*Same as house robber but the minor difference is that now last element is adjacent to first one 
*So we can make two vectors to store values of different indexes first one from 0 to n-1 and second from 1 t0 n
*Remain logic is same as that of house robber that include and exculde element and then find max one from that and return that max elemnent

Complexity
Time:-O(n),for finding max sum of adjacent elements
Space:-O(n),for storing both different index elements
