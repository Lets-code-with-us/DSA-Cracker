This C++ code aims to find the maximum product of a subarray within a given vector of integers (nums). It iterates through the array, 
maintaining two variables (currMax and currMin) to keep track of the maximum and minimum products ending at the current index. When a
negative number is encountered, it swaps currMax and currMin to correctly handle the change in sign. The algorithm dynamically updates these
variables while traversing the array, and the final result is stored in the variable maxi, representing the maximum product of any subarray 
within the vector. The result is then returned as the output of the function. This approach ensures that the algorithm considers the impact
of negative numbers on both the maximum and minimum products, providing an accurate solution for finding the maximum product subarray.
