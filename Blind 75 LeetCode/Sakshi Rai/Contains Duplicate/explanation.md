The C++ code defines a class Solution with a member function containsDuplicate that takes a vector of integers 
nums as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the array contains any duplicates. The function uses a set
named unique to keep track of unique elements encountered while iterating through the input array. For each element 
in the array, it checks if it already exists in the set; if found, it returns true indicating the presence of a duplicate, 
otherwise, it inserts the element into the set. The time complexity (TC) is O(n) where n is the size of the input array, 
as each element is processed once. The space complexity (SC) is O(n) as the set may store all elements in the worst case, 
resulting in linear space consumption.
