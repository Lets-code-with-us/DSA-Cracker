The C++ code defines a class Solution with a public function maxProfit that takes a vector of stock prices as input 
and returns the maximum profit that can be obtained from buying and selling the stock. The algorithm iterates through the
prices, maintaining a minimum price and updating the maximum profit whenever a higher profit is found. The minimum price is 
updated if a lower price is encountered, and the maximum profit is updated if the difference between the current price and 
the minimum price is greater than the current maximum profit. The time complexity (TC) is O(n) as it iterates through the 
prices once, and the space complexity (SC) is O(1) since only a constant amount of space is used regardless of the input size.
