The C++ code implements the binary search algorithm to find a target element in a rotated sorted array. The algorithm maintains two pointers,
's' and 'e', representing the start and end indices of the search range. It calculates the middle index 'mid' and compares the element at 'mid' 
with the target. If a match is found, it returns the index. Otherwise, it checks whether the left or right half is sorted and adjusts the pointers 
accordingly. The search continues in the sorted half where the target might be present. This process is repeated until the target is found or the
search range is exhausted, in which case -1 is returned to indicate that the target is not present in the array. The algorithm has a time complexity
of O(log N), where N is the size of the input array.
