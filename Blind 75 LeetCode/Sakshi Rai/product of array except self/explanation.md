The C++ code defines a class with a method productExceptSelf to solve the "Product of Array Except Self" problem
It initializes two vectors, left and right, to store the products of elements to the left and right of each array index. 
The first loop calculates the products to the left by iteratively updating a running product and populating the left vector.
Similarly, the second loop calculates the products to the right in a backward iteration and populates the right vector. 
Finally, a third loop combines the left and right products to form the output array, where each element represents the product 
of all other elements in the original array except itself. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) due to three linear
passes through the array and uses O(n) additional space for the two auxiliary vectors. This approach ensures an optimal 
solution for the given problem statement.
