This C++ code implements a binary search algorithm to find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array. The algorithm uses two pointers,
left and right, initialized to the start and end of the array, respectively. It repeatedly calculates the middle index (mid) and compares the 
element at mid with the element at left. If the element at mid is greater than or equal to the element at left, it means the minimum element lies
in the right half, so the left pointer is moved to mid + 1. Otherwise, if the element at mid is less than the element at left, it means the minimum
element lies in the left half, so the right pointer is moved to mid - 1. The process continues until the pointers meet, and the minimum element
encountered during the search is returned. The ans variable is used to keep track of the minimum element found throughout the search.
