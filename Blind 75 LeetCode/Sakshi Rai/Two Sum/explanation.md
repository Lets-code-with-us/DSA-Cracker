The C++ program defines a function twoSum that efficiently solves the Two Sum problem using an map
to store the complement of each element and its index. 
It iterates through the input array, calculates the complement needed to achieve the target sum, and checks if the complement 
is already in the hashmap. If found, it returns the indices of the two numbers; otherwise, it adds the current element and 
its index to the hashmap. The main function demonstrates the usage of this function with three examples, 
printing the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target in each case, following the specified problem constraints.
