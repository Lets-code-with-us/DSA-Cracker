# Code Explanation: Maximum product subarray - Python Solution

## Explanation:

- Initialize maxi to a very large negative number (since the product could be negative, and the maximum product might start with a negative number).

- Initialize prod to 1. This variable will hold the current product of elements in a subarray.

- Iterate through the nums list from the beginning to the end.

- Update prod by multiplying it with the current element nums[i].

- Update maxi to the maximum of prod and maxi.

- If prod becomes zero (indicating the start of a new subarray), reset prod to 1 to start calculating the product of the next subarray.
Reset prod to 1.

- Iterate through the nums list from the end to the beginning:
Similar to the previous loop, update prod, maxi, and reset prod to 1 when encountering a zero.

- Return maxi, which holds the maximum product of contiguous subarrays.

## Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
