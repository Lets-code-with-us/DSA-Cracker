# Code Explanation: Longest Common Subsequence - Python Solution

## Explanation:

- We define a class Solution with a method longestCommonSubsequence that takes two strings text1 and text2 as input.
- We initialize variables len_text1 and len_text2 to store the lengths of text1 and text2, respectively.
- We create a 2D dynamic programming (DP) matrix dp_matrix of size (len_text1 + 1) x (len_text2 + 1). The extra row and column are for handling empty strings.
- We iterate through each character of text1 and text2 using nested loops.
- If the characters at the current positions are equal, we increment the value in the DP matrix by 1 compared to the diagonal element.
- If the characters are not equal, we take the maximum of the element above and the element to the left.
- Finally, we return the value in the bottom-right corner of the DP matrix, which represents the length of the longest common subsequence.

## Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(m*n)
- Space Complexity: O(m*n)
