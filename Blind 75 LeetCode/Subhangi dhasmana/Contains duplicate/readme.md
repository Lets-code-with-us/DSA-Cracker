# Code Explanation: Contains duplicate - Python Solution

## Explanation:

- Dictionary Initialization: The code initializes an empty dictionary mp. This dictionary will be used to store the count of occurrences of each unique element in the input list nums.

- Counting Occurrences: The code then iterates through each element num in the input list nums. For each element num, it updates the count of occurrences in the dictionary mp. It does this by using the get method of dictionaries. If num is not already a key in the dictionary mp, it sets its count to 0 and then adds 1 to it. If num is already a key, it increments its count by 1.

- Checking for Duplicates: After counting the occurrences of each element, the code iterates through the values of the dictionary mp. If any value is greater than 1, it means that the corresponding element occurred more than once in the input list, indicating the presence of duplicates. In this case, the function returns True.

- Return False: If no duplicates are found after iterating through all the values in the dictionary, the function returns False, indicating that the input list contains no duplicates.

## Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
