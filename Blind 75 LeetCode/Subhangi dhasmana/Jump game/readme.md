# Code Explanation: Jump game - Python Solution

## Explanation:

- The variable gas represents the amount of "fuel" available for jumping. It starts at 0.
- The loop iterates through each element n in the nums list.
- Inside the loop:

1. If gas becomes negative, it means that it's not possible to proceed further, hence returning False.
2. If the current element n is greater than the current gas, it means that it's beneficial to consume this n and replenish the gas.
3. Subtract 1 from gas after each jump, assuming one unit of fuel is consumed for each jump.
- If the loop completes without encountering a negative gas, it means that it's possible to reach the end of the list, returning True.

## Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
