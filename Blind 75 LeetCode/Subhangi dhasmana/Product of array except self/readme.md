# Code Explanation: Product of array except self - Python Solution

## Explanation:

- First, it initializes an answer array ans of the same length as the input nums, with each element initialized to 1. This array will hold the final result.

- Then, it iterates through the array from left to right (except for the first element), and computes the product of all elements to the left of the current element. This is done by keeping a running product and updating ans[i] accordingly.

- After completing the first pass, it initializes a variable right to hold the product of all elements to the right of the current element. It starts with the last element of the input array.

- Then, it iterates through the array from right to left (except for the last element), updating each ans[i] by multiplying it with right and updating right by multiplying it with the corresponding element in nums.

- Finally, it returns the answer array ans, which now contains the product of every element in the input array except itself.

## Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
