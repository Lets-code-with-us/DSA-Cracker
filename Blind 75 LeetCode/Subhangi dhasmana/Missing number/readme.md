# Code Explanation: Missing number - Python Solution

## Explanation:

- Calculate the expected sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula (n*(n+1))//2.
- Iterate through the given list and calculate the sum of its elements.
- Subtract the sum of the list from the expected sum to find the missing number.
- Return the missing number.

## Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
