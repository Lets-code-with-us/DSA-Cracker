# Code Explanation: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array - Python Solution

## Explanation:

- The function findMin takes a list of integers nums as input and returns the minimum element in the rotated sorted array.

- It initializes two pointers s and e to the start and end of the array respectively.

- It also initializes a variable ans to store the minimum value, initialized with a large value 2**31-1.

- It enters a while loop as long as the start index s is less than the end index e.

- Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index mid using integer division of the sum of s and e by 2.

- It checks if the element at index s is less than or equal to the element at index mid. If true, it updates ans with the minimum of ans and the element at index s, and moves the start pointer s to mid + 1.

- If the condition is false, it updates ans with the minimum of ans and the element at index mid, and moves the end pointer e to mid - 1.

- Once the loop exits, it returns the value of ans which holds the minimum element found during the search.

## Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
